You might need to look at your book (till Chapter 6) and the example code under Lecture 3 on the blackboard to complete this. You will want to use the virtual machine installed on the lab computers for this.

Submission method: 
1.	Submit a small description of your solution (the steps you followed to get to the solution  mention the files you edited)
2.	Relevant code snippets (paste here the parts you edited/added in the standard application), and screen shots. 

I will only grade based on what you pasted here. If I dont see the description and code here, I cannot grade it. 

Submit a soft copy of the document using the assignment link on the blackboard. 

1.	Design and implement a small Instructor List web application. 
a.	The main page will show a listing of all Instructors in the database. The instructor details (name, office number, email) should be stored in a SQLite database. Please use the Generate Model and Migration functionality in Rails to do this. Add test data to the instructor table using the seeds.rb file. Refer to the example code completed in class (under Lecture 3). 
b.	Alter the instructor table to add the department name for the instructor. See Section 22.2 in book for the method to alter a table structure.

COSC 617  Advanced Web Development  ORM Lab

10 points
Due: The day before next class, 11:59pm
This programming exercise is aimed at giving you your first experiences is developing a small Rails application. You might need to look at your book (till Chapter 6) and the example code under Lecture 3 on the blackboard to complete this. You will want to use the virtual machine installed on the lab computers for this.

Submission method: 
1.	Submit a small description of your solution (the steps you followed to get to the solution  mention the files you edited)
2.	Relevant code snippets (paste here the parts you edited/added in the standard application), and screen shots. 

I will only grade based on what you pasted here. If I dont see the description and code here, I cannot grade it. 

Submit a soft copy of the document using the assignment link on the blackboard. 

1.	Design and implement a small Instructor List web application. 
a.	The main page will show a listing of all Instructors in the database. The instructor details (name, office number, email) should be stored in a SQLite database. Please use the Generate Model and Migration functionality in Rails to do this. Add test data to the instructor table using the seeds.rb file. Refer to the example code completed in class (under Lecture 3). 
b.	Alter the instructor table to add the department name for the instructor. See Section 22.2 in book for the method to alter a table structure.

This programming exercise is aimed at giving you your first experiences is developing a small Rails application. You might need to look at your book (till Chapter 6) and the example code under Lecture 3 on the blackboard to complete this. You will want to use the virtual machine installed on the lab computers for this.

Submission method: 
1.	Submit a small description of your solution (the steps you followed to get to the solution  mention the files you edited)
2.	Relevant code snippets (paste here the parts you edited/added in the standard application), and screen shots. 

I will only grade based on what you pasted here. If I dont see the description and code here, I cannot grade it. 

Submit a soft copy of the document using the assignment link on the blackboard. 

1.	Design and implement a small Instructor List web application. 
a.	The main page will show a listing of all Instructors in the database. The instructor details (name, office number, email) should be stored in a SQLite database. Please use the Generate Model and Migration functionality in Rails to do this. Add test data to the instructor table using the seeds.rb file. Refer to the example code completed in class (under Lecture 3). 
b.	Alter the instructor table to add the department name for the instructor. See Section 22.2 in book for the method to alter a table structure.

This programming exercise is aimed at giving you your first experiences is developing a small Rails application. You might need to look at your book (till Chapter 6) and the example code under Lecture 3 on the blackboard to complete this. You will want to use the virtual machine installed on the lab computers for this.

Submission method: 
1.	Submit a small description of your solution (the steps you followed to get to the solution  mention the files you edited)
2.	Relevant code snippets (paste here the parts you edited/added in the standard application), and screen shots. 

I will only grade based on what you pasted here. If I dont see the description and code here, I cannot grade it. 

Submit a soft copy of the document using the assignment link on the blackboard.

a.	The main page will show a listing of all Instructors in the database. The instructor details (name, office number, email) should be stored in a SQLite database. Please use the Generate Model and Migration functionality in Rails to do this. Add test data to the instructor table using the seeds.rb file.

You might need to look at your book (till Chapter 6) and the example code under Lecture 3 on the blackboard to complete this. You will want to use the virtual machine installed on the lab computers for this.

2.	Relevant code snippets (paste here the parts you edited/added in the standard application), and screen shots. 

I will only grade based on what you pasted here. If I dont see the description and code here, I cannot grade it. 

Submit a soft copy of the document using the assignment link on the blackboard.

a.	The main page will show a listing of all Instructors in the database. The instructor details (name, office number, email) should be stored in a SQLite database. Please use the Generate Model and Migration functionality in Rails to do this. Add test data to the instructor table using the seeds.rb file.

COSC 617  Advanced Web Development  ORM Lab

10 points
Due: The day before next class, 11:59pm
This programming exercise is aimed at giving you your first experiences is developing a small Rails application. You might need to look at your book (till Chapter 6) and the example code under Lecture 3 on the blackboard to complete this. You will want to use the virtual machine installed on the lab computers for this.

Submission method: 
1.	Submit a small description of your solution (the steps you followed to get to the solution  mention the files you edited)
2.	Relevant code snippets (paste here the parts you edited/added in the standard application), and screen shots. 

I will only grade based on what you pasted here. If I dont see the description and code here, I cannot grade it. 

Submit a soft copy of the document using the assignment link on the blackboard. 

1.	Design and implement a small Instructor List web application. 
a.	The main page will show a listing of all Instructors in the database. The instructor details (name, office number, email) should be stored in a SQLite database. Please use the Generate Model and Migration functionality in Rails to do this. Add test data to the instructor table using the seeds.rb file. Refer to the example code completed in class (under Lecture 3). 
b.	Alter the instructor table to add the department name for the instructor. See Section 22.2 in book for the method to alter a table structure.

COSC 617  Advanced Web Development  ORM Lab
<p>
10 points
Due: The day before next class, 11:59pm
This programming exercise is aimed at giving you your first experiences is developing a small Rails application. You might need to look at your book (till Chapter 6) and the example code under Lecture 3 on the blackboard to complete this. You will want to use the virtual machine installed on the lab computers for this.

Submission method: 
1.	Submit a small description of your solution (the steps you followed to get to the solution  mention the files you edited)
2.	Relevant code snippets (paste here the parts you edited/added in the standard application), and screen shots. 

I will only grade based on what you pasted here. If I dont see the description and code here, I cannot grade it. 

Submit a soft copy of the document using the assignment link on the blackboard. 

1.	Design and implement a small Instructor List web application. 
a.	The main page will show a listing of all Instructors in the database. The instructor details (name, office number, email) should be stored in a SQLite database. Please use the Generate Model and Migration functionality in Rails to do this. Add test data to the instructor table using the seeds.rb file. Refer to the example code completed in class (under Lecture 3). 
b.	Alter the instructor table to add the department name for the instructor. See Section 22.2 in book for the method to alter a table structure.
